# A Borgesian Contraption

A Borgesian Contraption is some generative text software developed by my friend Toros Garabaldian. For more information on the history of this project, [read this](https://aborgesiancontraption.net/about).

The basis for [the original project](https://github.com/gjtorikian/a-borgesian-contraption-v1) was a machine learning system build upon GPT-2. For more information on this, [read this](https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/).

This project uses [the OpenAI's API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction/overview) implementing GPT-3.
